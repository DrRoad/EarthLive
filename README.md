###Links:

1. The NASA [Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/science-system-description/eosdis-components/global-imagery-browse-services-gibs) project provides historical and near real-time daily global images taken from space through standard protocols.  These imagery products show true color pictures and representations of remotely sensed science parameters (e.g. Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Ice Concentration, etc.)
2. The [Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)](http://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is a prototype web service that provides curated natural event metadata linking to web service-enabled image sources
3. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides the most accurate and comprehensive collection of rain and snowfall ever assembled. The public can utilize this data for climate studies, weather analysis, and other applications
4. Leverage NASA’s land surface data found in [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
5. [ClimateSERV](http://climateserv.nsstc.nasa.gov/) is a tool that allows development practitioners, scientists/researchers, and government decision-makers to visualize and download historical rainfall data, vegetation condition data, and 180-day forecasts of rainfall and temperature to improve understanding of, and make improved decisions for, issues related to agriculture and water availability.

###Tips:

1. Organize NASA MODIS land surface temperature product for remote assimilation into SERVIR’s ClimateSERV tool. ClimateSERV provides basic analysis and download capability for low internet-bandwidth users in SERVIR regions.
